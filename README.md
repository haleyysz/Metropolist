## Technologies
*This project will require development of a server (using either Node or Java/Spring) along with a database (using either MySQL or Mongo). The prototype will be web-based. There may also be an Android app if time allows.*

## Samples
*This project will attempt to achieve the quality and style of hand-created maps such as the following:*
