# Metropolist
## Functional Requirements
*This web application allows users to create randomly generated fantasy maps of cities and additionally allows user to annotate and edit city elements at a fine granularity.*

## Roles

## Admin 
* As an <code>admin</code>, I want to be able to:
  * Log in
  * Log out
  * Edit my profile
  * Search for a user using any combination of email, username, first name and last name
  * Enable and disable any user (not including admins)

## User
* As a user, I want to be able to
  * Log in
  * Log out
  * Edit my profile
  * View and search-for users
  * View a page that lists all of my maps
  * Create/edit/delete a map
  * Make maps public, private, or viewable by only a select list of users
  * Annotate a map
    1. Tag buildings with details related to the building.
    1. Include virtual-people as owners, residents, or others.
    1. Include relationship between virtual-peoples (family, business, sentiments)
    
## Technologies
*This project will require development of a server (using either Node or Java/Spring) along with a database (using either MySQL or Mongo). The prototype will be web-based. There may also be an Android app if time allows.*

## Samples
*This project will attempt to achieve the quality and style of hand-created maps such as the following:*
